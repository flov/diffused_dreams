      4. Newsletter
    </h1>
    <p>
      We send newsletters and other notifications by email and through other communication channels and may deliver them with the help of third parties.
  
      In principle, you must expressly consent to receive newsletters and other notifications from us, unless this is permitted for other legal reasons. We use "double opt-in" for any consent in the case of e-mails, i.e. you will receive an e-mail with a web link that you must click to confirm, so that no misuse by unauthorized third parties can take place. We may log such consents including Internet Protocol (IP) address, date and time.
  
      Newsletters and other notifications may contain web links or tracking pixels that record whether an individual newsletter or notification has been opened and which web links were clicked (performance measurement). Such web links and tracking pixels record the use of newsletters and other notifications. We use this statistical recording of usage, including success and reach measurement, in order to be able to offer newsletters and other notifications effectively and in a user-friendly manner, as well as permanently, securely and reliably, based on the reading habits of the recipients.
  
      You can unsubscribe from newsletters and other notifications at any time and thereby object in particular to the aforementioned collection of usage. You can do so by contacting us directly or following the link included in the footer of each newsletter we send you.
    </p>
  
    <h1 class="text-info text-bold text-xl py-2">
      5. Data retention
    </h1>
    <p>
      We retain personal data for so long as it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected and in line with legal and regulatory requirements or contractual arrangements. After this period, we delete or fully anonymize your personal data.
    </p>
  
    <h1 class="text-info text-bold text-xl py-2">
      6. Data recipients
    </h1>
    <p>
      We engage third-party companies ("service providers") to facilitate the operation of our services, assist in analyzing the usage of the services, or perform necessary services, such as payment and the provision of IT infrastructure. These third parties have access to your personal data only to the extent necessary to perform these tasks.
  
      Type(s) of service providers who might access your personal data:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc px-4">
      <li>Insurers</li>

      <li>Professional advisers that we use, such as accountants and lawyers</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h1 class="text-info text-bold text-xl py-2">
      7. Data transfers
    </h1>
    <p>
      We and/or our service providers may transfer your personal data to and process it in the US.
  
      We may use service providers partly located in so-called third countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area) or process personal data there, i.e. countries whose level of data protection does not correspond to that of the EU.
  
      We safeguard your personal data per our contractual obligations and applicable data protection legislation when transferring data abroad.
  
      Such safeguards may include:
  
      the transfer to to countries where there is an adequacy decision by the European Commission in place;
  
      applying standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules or other standard contractual obligations that provide appropriate data protection.
  
      If a third country transfer takes place and there is no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the third country (e.g. intelligence services) can gain access to the transferred data and that the enforceability of your data subject's rights cannot be guaranteed.
    </p>
  
    <h1 class="text-info text-bold text-xl py-2">
      8. Data disclosure
    </h1>
    <p>
      We may disclose your personal data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc px-4">
      <li>To comply with a legal obligation (i.e., if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, such as a court or government agency)</li>
      <li>To protect the security of our services and defend our rights or property</li>
      <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with us</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h1 class="text-info text-bold text-xl py-2">
      9. Data security
    </h1>
    <p>
      We take reasonable technical and organizational security measures that we deem appropriate to protect your stored data against manipulation, loss, or unauthorized third-party access. Our security measures are continually adapted to technological developments.
  
      We also take internal data privacy very seriously. Our employees and the service providers that we engage are required to maintain secrecy and comply with applicable data protection legislation. In addition, they are granted access to personal data only insofar as this is necessary for them to carry out their respective tasks or mandate.
  
      The security of your personal data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We recommend using antivirus software, a firewall, and other similar software to safeguard your system.
    </p>
  
    <h1 class="text-info text-bold text-xl py-2">
      10. Your rights

      Right to amendment: You have the right to ask us to correct our records if you believe they contain incorrect or incomplete information about you.
  
      Right to withdraw consent: If you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. This includes cases where you wish to opt-out from marketing communications. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you initially consented to unless there is another legal basis for processing. To stop receiving emails from us, please click on the 'unsubscribe' link in the email you received or contact us at info@phantaisia.com.
  
      Right to erasure: You have the right to request that we delete your personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or when it was unlawfully processed.
  
      Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to request the restriction of our processing of your personal data where you believe it to be inaccurate, our processing is unlawful, or where we no longer need to process it for the initial purpose, but where we are not able to delete it due to a legal obligation or because you do not want us to delete it.
  
      Right to portability: You have the right to request that we transmit your personal data to another data controller in a standard format such as Excel, if this is data which you have provided to us and if we are processing it on the legal basis of your consent or to perform our contractual obligations.
  
      Right to object to processing: Where the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your particular situation. We will abide by your request unless we have a compelling legal basis for the processing which overrides your interests or if we need to continue to process the personal data for the exercise or defense of a legal claim.
  
      Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: You have the right of appeal to a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data protection law. In the EU and EEA, you can exercise this right, for example, before a supervisory authority in the Member State of your residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. You can find a list of the relevant authorities here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.

      11. Links to third-party apps and sites
    </h1>
    <p>
      Our services contain links to websites or apps that are not operated by us. When you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's website or app. We have no control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.
  
      We maintain online presences on social networks to, among other things, communicate with customers and prospective customers and to provide information about our products and services. If you have an account on the same network, it is possible that your information and media made available there may be seen by us, for example, when we access your profile. In addition, the social network may allow us to contact you. As soon as we transfer personal data into our own system, we are responsible for this independently. This is then done to carry out pre-contractual measures and to fulfil a contract. For the legal basis of the data processing carried out by the social networks under their own responsibility, please refer to their data protection declarations. Below is a list of social networks on which we operate an online presence:
